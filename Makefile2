# Sample Makefile with Different Functions for Targets

# Function for target1
function1:
	@echo "This is function1 for target1."
	@echo "You can put target-specific commands here."
	@echo "For example, for target1, you can add:"
	@echo "  - Command 1 for target1"
	@echo "  - Command 2 for target1"

# Function for target2
function2:
	@echo "This is function2 for target2."
	@echo "You can put target-specific commands here."
	@echo "For example, for target2, you can add:"
	@echo "  - Command 1 for target2"
	@echo "  - Command 2 for target2"

# Targets that use the functions
target1:
	@echo "Running Target 1"
	@$(MAKE) function1

target2:
	@echo "Running Target 2"
	@$(MAKE) function2

# Default target (when you run 'make' without specifying a target)
all: target1 target2
